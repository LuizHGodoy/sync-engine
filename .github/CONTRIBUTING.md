## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

- `feature/feature-name` - New features
- `fix/bug-description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/documentation-update` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/refactor-description` - Code refactoring
- `test/test-description` - Test additions/updates

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```bash
type(scope): description

Examples:
feat(sync): add batch synchronization support
fix(queue): resolve memory leak in queue storage
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(sync): add unit tests for conflict resolution
```

### Types

- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `style` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `test` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Provide proper type definitions
- Use strict type checking
- Document complex types with JSDoc comments

### Code Style

- Use descriptive variable and function names in English
- Follow existing code formatting
- Use Prettier for consistent formatting
- Use ESLint rules when available

### Error Handling

- Use proper error handling with try/catch blocks
- Provide meaningful error messages in English
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

### Documentation

- Document all public APIs
- Use JSDoc comments for functions and classes
- Keep README files up to date
- Provide examples for new features

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
yarn test

# Run tests for specific package
cd packages/sync-engine-lib
yarn test

# Run tests in watch mode
yarn test --watch
```

### Test Guidelines

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Ensure good test coverage
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe("FeatureName", () => {
  describe("when condition", () => {
    it("should do expected behavior", () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make your changes following the coding standards
3. Add or update tests as needed
4. Update documentation if necessary
