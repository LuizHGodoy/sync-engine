## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Sync Engine team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by email to:

üìß **<security@sync-engine.dev>** (or contact repository maintainer directly)

Include the following information in your report:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What an attacker could achieve
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- **Affected versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Suggested fix**: If you have ideas for remediation

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: We'll investigate and assess the vulnerability
3. **Timeline**: We'll provide an estimated timeline for a fix
4. **Updates**: We'll keep you informed of our progress
5. **Credit**: We'll credit you in the security advisory (if desired)

### Response Timeline

- **Critical vulnerabilities**: 24-48 hours for initial response
- **High severity**: 72 hours for initial response
- **Medium/Low severity**: 1 week for initial response

## Security Measures

### Library Security

The Sync Engine library implements several security measures:

#### Data Protection

- **Local storage encryption**: Sensitive data in SQLite is handled securely
- **Network encryption**: All HTTP requests should use HTTPS
- **No sensitive data logging**: Debug mode doesn't log sensitive information

#### Authentication

- **Configurable auth headers**: Support for Bearer tokens, API keys, and Basic auth
- **Token management**: No tokens are stored in plain text logs
- **Secure transmission**: All authentication data sent over secure channels

#### Input Validation

- **Schema validation**: All data is validated against TypeScript interfaces
- **SQL injection prevention**: Uses parameterized queries
- **XSS prevention**: No direct HTML rendering of user data

### Network Security

#### Transport Security

- **HTTPS enforcement**: All production endpoints should use HTTPS
- **Certificate validation**: Proper SSL/TLS certificate validation
- **Request timeouts**: Protection against hung connections

#### Data Integrity

- **Request signing**: Optional request signing for data integrity
- **Conflict resolution**: Secure handling of data conflicts
- **Audit trail**: Comprehensive logging of sync operations

### Mobile Security

#### React Native/Expo

- **Secure storage**: Integration with secure storage solutions
- **Background sync**: Secure handling of background operations
- **Network detection**: Proper handling of network state changes

#### Permissions

- **Minimal permissions**: Only requests necessary permissions
- **Data access**: Limited access to device data
- **Network access**: Controlled network access patterns

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers Using Sync Engine

#### Configuration

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Use HTTPS endpoints
const config = {
  serverUrl: "https://api.example.com",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`, // Use secure token storage
  },
};

// ‚ùå Bad: Don't use HTTP in production
const config = {
  serverUrl: "http://api.example.com", // Insecure!
};
```

#### Authentication examples

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Secure token handling
const token = await SecureStore.getItemAsync("auth_token");
syncEngine.updateConfig({
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
});

// ‚ùå Bad: Don't hardcode tokens
const config = {
  headers: { Authorization: "Bearer hardcoded-token" }, // Insecure!
};
```

#### Error Handling

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Don't expose sensitive data in errors
try {
  await syncEngine.sync();
} catch (error) {
  console.log("Sync failed"); // Generic error message
  // Log detailed error securely for debugging
}

// ‚ùå Bad: Don't log sensitive data
catch (error) {
  console.log(error.response.data); // May contain sensitive data
}
```

### For Server Implementation

#### API Security

- Use proper authentication (JWT, OAuth, etc.)
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate all inputs
- Use HTTPS only
- Implement proper CORS policies

#### Data Handling

- Sanitize all inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper access controls
- Audit data access
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest

## Vulnerability Disclosure

### Public Disclosure Timeline

1. **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported privately
2. **Day 1-3**: Initial assessment and acknowledgment
3. **Day 7-14**: Investigation and fix development
4. **Day 14-30**: Testing and validation of fix
5. **Day 30**: Public disclosure with security advisory

### Security Advisories

Security advisories will be published on:
